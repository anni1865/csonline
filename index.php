This is very much my own experiment in quickly building a MOOC infrastructure out
of open source pieces glued together with IMS LTI.

Login using your Google Account, set up your profile and then launch into the 
Playground course and see if you can get all 300 points from the Auto-Grader!
Show off your Mad Python  Skillz and/or find bugs in my code.   You won't be able to launch 
into Moodle until you log in.

If you want an extra special challenge, figure out how to <i>game</i> the autograder and
write a program that matches the final output but does not meet the specs.   Warning, 
I have code in the autograder to catch you if you don't meet the specs.  Good luck trying to
defeat my sanity checker.

Comments welcome.
