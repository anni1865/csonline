This site is under construction.  But if you switch the language to Swedish, 
it is like shopping at <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_new">IKEA</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Some of the other pages have more stuff in them.
And you can log in with your Google account and get on the mailing list - of
course I still have to write software that sends mail from that list.
</p>
<p>
My next task is the profile page and then the courses page to give you a way to enroll
in the *single* course.   Then I need to to the LTI Launch into my special copy of 
<a href="http://moodle.dr-chuck.com/moodle/" target="_new">Moodle</a> - and then ....
<p>
If you are bored already, you can play a bit with my Python 
<a href="http://lti-tools.dr-chuck.com/pythonauto/" target="_new">Autograder</a>.
See if you can do all four problems.
<p>
Just keep checking back.
